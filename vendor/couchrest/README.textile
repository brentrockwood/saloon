h1. Yet Another CouchDB Library

Yeah that's right, yet another "CouchDB":http://couchdb.org library. Like all the others, mine has its own originality.
It is a fork of "jchris's CouchRest":http://github.com/jchris/couchrest. Everything started as an Hardcore Forking Action. I ended:

* Modifying the organisation of the library
* Writing more tests. The legacy tests are more integration test while those I wrote are unit tests.
* DRY it up

h2. Example

bc.. server = CouchRest.new
database = server.database('articles')
database.save(:title => 'foo', :content => 'bar')
database.view('articles/by_author', :key => 'John Doe')

h2. Requirements

The fellowing gems are required:

* rest-client
* addressable

To run the test, you also need :

* test/spec
* mocha
* rcov
* rspec (for the legacy tests)

and yard to generate the documentation.
